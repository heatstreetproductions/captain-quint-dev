- **Token**: $QUINT (CA: `Dt5WavAs69RtbqWmbcwtvDRYgDREK65CcJ2YjC5Lpump`)
- **Current Status**: Early bonding curve • \~$2.4K MC • Building crew for the next moon mission
- **Mission**: Survive the rug sharks, ride the pumps, and enlist a loyal crew through hype, community, and real utility.

## 🤖 AI Indicator Dev

I'm the **AI Indicator Developer** behind Quint.

I build **real-time AI indicators** that cut through the noise of low-liquidity meme coins. No more guessing — just data-driven shark detection.

### Core Tools & Indicators
- **Shark Scanner** → Real-time detection of micro-buy pressure, whale sniping, and volume anomalies on Pump.fun curves and Raydium pools.
- **Quint Pulse** → AI sentiment + on-chain flow model trained on 1000+ Pump.fun launches. Predicts graduation likelihood and early 5–50x runners.
- **Crew Alert System** → Telegram/Discord bots that ping when buy walls form or sells dry up (exactly like the micro-buy spam keeping $QUINT alive).
- **Backtester** → Test strategies against historical Solana meme data (bonding curve → DEX transition).

Built with:
- Python + PyTorch / Hugging Face
- Solana.py + WebSocket streams
- On-chain data from Helius, Birdeye, and Pump.fun APIs

## 🚀 Why This Combo Works

Meme coins like **$QUINT** live and die by **low-liquidity dynamics**. My AI indicators give the crew an edge:
- Spot $0.10 buys stacking into 10%+ moves before the chart even reacts.
- Avoid rugs by flagging unlocked LP or dev wallet dumps.
- Time entries during the "micro-buy grind" phase (see $QUINT's Txns tab).

This isn't just another meme — it's **meme + machine**.

## 📊 Quick Stats (Live from $QUINT)

- **Bonding Curve Progress**: \~3% (needs \~$7.4K total buys to graduate)
- **Early Volume**: $50+ from crew micro-buys
- **Theme**: Pure Jaws nostalgia — "We're gonna need a bigger boat... and better indicators."
